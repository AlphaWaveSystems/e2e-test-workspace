## Harness connection

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `http://127.0.0.1:7700` |
| Liveness probe | `GET http://127.0.0.1:7700/harness/ready` (no auth) |
| Health | `GET http://127.0.0.1:7700/harness/health` (JWT required) |
| MCP tools | `POST http://127.0.0.1:7700/mcp` |
| A2A tasks | `POST http://127.0.0.1:7700/a2a/tasks` |

Harness runs as a macOS launchd daemon — auto-starts on login, restarts on crash.
Logs: `~/Library/Logs/central-harness.log`
Manage: `harness-ctl daemon status | start | stop | restart`

## Deployment targets



*(no deployment targets detected — add manually)*


---

## Credential vault scopes

The harness vault holds credentials. This agent (`e2e-test-workspace`) is granted:


- **`github`** — (vault scope — see harness vault config) (expires: 30 minutes)



Request a scoped token (JWT required):
```
POST http://127.0.0.1:7700/harness/vault/token
{"scope": "<scope>"}
→ {"token": "...", "expiresIn": 1800}
```

**Do not use these environment variables directly in tool calls** — request vault tokens instead.
The harness injects credentials per-request and they expire automatically.
